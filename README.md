# summerterm19
This is a Folder containing course materials for the summer term 2019

Over the course of this seminar, we will be continously adding materials to this repository.
For now, due to access neccessities, this is a public repository.

After our introductory session to GitHub, you will be given access privileges to this repo.
In a couple of weeks time, this repository will be switched to private mode, so nobody outside
our course can access the files that you upload.
